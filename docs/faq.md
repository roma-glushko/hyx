## No Sync Support?

That's right. Hyx was only intended to support asyncio-based applications. 
The sync support would require to rethink implemented primitives in terms of multithreading. 
So that will require a bit of effort. As of now, there is no plans to work on that. 
However, that might change based on the community feedback and demand.
