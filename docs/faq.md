## No Sync Support?

That's right. Hyx was only intended to support asyncio-based applications.
The sync support would require rethinking implemented primitives in terms of multithreading.
So that will require a bit of effort. As of now, there are no plans to work on that.
However, that might change based on the community feedback and demand.
