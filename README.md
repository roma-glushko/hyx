**Hyx** (/Ààh å…™x/) is a set of well-known stability patterns that are commonly needed
when you build [microservice-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) applications.
Hyx is meant to be [Hystrix (Java)](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix), [resilience4j (Java)](https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j) or [Polly (C#)](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) but for the Python world.

## Key Features

- Implements five commonly used resiliency patterns with various configurations based on advice and experience of industry leaders (e.g. AWS, Google, Netflix)
- Idiomatic Pythonic implementation based on [decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators) and [context managers](https://realpython.com/python-with-statement)
- [AsyncIO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) Native Implementation
- Lightweight. Readable Codebase. High Test Coverage

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- AsyncIO-powered applications ([no sync support?](./faq.md))

## Installation

Hyx can be installed from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/hyx):

``` sh
pip install hyx

# or via poetry
poetry add hyx
```

| üîÅ Retry           | The failures happen sometimes, but they self-recover after a short time                                                                                                            | Automatically retry operation on temporary failures                                                                                                                           | ‚úÖ            |

| ‚ö°Ô∏è Circuit Breaker | When downstream microservices have got overloaded, sending even more load can make the situation only worse.                                                                       | Stop doing requests to your failing microservice temporarily if amount of errors exceeded expected thresholds. Then see if the given time helped the microservice to recover  | ‚úÖ            |
| ‚è± Timeout         | Sometimes operations may take too much time. We cannot wait that long or after that time the success is unlikely                                                                   | Bound waiting to a reasonable amount of time                                                                                                                                  | ‚úÖ            |
| üö∞ Bulkhead        | If executed without control, some code can take too much resources and put down the whole application (and upstream services) or cause slowness of other places of the application | Fix the amount of calls to the code, queue other calls and fail calls that goes beyond your capacity                                                                          | ‚úÖ            |

| ü§ù Fallback        | Nothing can guarantee you that your dependencies will work. What would you do when it's failing?                                                                                   | Degrade gracefully by defining some default values or placeholders if your dependencies are down                                                                              | ‚úÖ            |
