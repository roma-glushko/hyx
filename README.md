    <em>üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èÔ∏èLightweight fault tolerance primitives for your resilient and modern Python microservices</em>
</p>

Hyx provides you with a toolkit that includes common fault tolerance patterns like:

- bulkhead
- cache
- circuit breaker
- circular buffer
- fallback
- rate limiter
- retries
- timeout / time limiter

All components are designed to be:

- asyncio-native
- in-memory first
- dependency-less

With that patterns you should be all set to start improving your resiliency right after the library installation.
