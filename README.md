Hyx provides you with a toolkit that includes common fault tolerance patterns like:

- bulkhead
- cache
- circuit breaker
- circular buffer
- fallback
- rate limiter
- retries
- timeout / time limiter

All components are designed to be:

- asyncio-native
- in-memory first
- dependency-less

With that patterns you should be all set to start improving your resiliency right after the library installation.

| ‚ö°Ô∏è Circuit Breaker | When downstream microservices have got overloaded, sending even more load can make the situation only worse.                                                                       | Stop doing requests to your failing microservice temporarily if amount of errors exceeded expected thresholds.

We cannot wait that long or after that time the success is unlikely                                                                   | Bound waiting to a reasonable amount of time                                                                                                                                  | ‚úÖ            |
|    üö∞ Bulkhead     | If executed without control, some code can take too much resources and put down the whole application (and upstream services) or cause slowness of other places of the application | Fix the amount of calls to the code, queue other calls and fail calls that goes beyond your capacity                                                                          | ‚úÖ            |
