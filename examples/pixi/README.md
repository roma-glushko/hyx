# Pixi ðŸ’Ž

Pixi is a sample jewelery shop architected as a cloud-native microservice system that uses Hyx to improve resiliency and fault tolerance.
Under the hood, Pixi uses modern asyncio Python to implement its microservices and run them in a Kubernetes environment.

The system implements all common features of an eCommerce website like product catalog browsing, cart and checkout, so on.

Itâ€™s easy to deploy with little to no configuration.
